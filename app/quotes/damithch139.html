<p align="left">One of the most dangerous (and evil) things ever injected into 
the project world is the notion of process maturity. Process maturity is for 
replicable manufacturing contexts. Projects are one-time shots. Replicability is 
never the primary issue on one-time shots. More evil than good has come from the 
notion that we should &quot;stick to the methodology.&quot; This is a recipe for 
non-adaptive death. I'd rather die by commission. <cite><br>
