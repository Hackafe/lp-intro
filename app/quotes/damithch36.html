<p> Testing by itself does not improve software quality. Test results are an indicator 
  of quality, but in and of themselves, they don't improve it. Trying to improve 
  software quality by increasing the amount of testing is like trying to lose 
  weight by weighing yourself more often. What you eat before you step onto the 
  scale determines how much you will weigh, and the software development techniques 
  you use determine how many errors testing will find. If you want to lose weight, 
  don't buy a new scale; change your diet. If you want to improve your software, 
  don't test more; develop better.<br>
