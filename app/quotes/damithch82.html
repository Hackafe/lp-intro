<p> More than the act of testing, the act of designing tests is one of the best 
  bug preventers known. The thinking that must be done to create a useful test 
  can discover and eliminate bugs before they are coded - indeed, test-design 
  thinking can discover and eliminate bugs at every stage in the creation of software, 
  from conception to specification, to design, coding and the rest. <br>
