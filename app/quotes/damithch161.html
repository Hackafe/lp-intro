<p align="left">By the time [the Leaning Tower of Pisa] was ten percent built, 
everyone knew it would be a total disaster. But the investment was so big they 
felt compelled to go on. Since its completion, it cost a fortune to maintain and 
is still in danger of collapsing. There are no plans to replace it, since it was 
never needed in the first place. I expect every installation has its own pet 
software which is analogous to the above. <cite><br>
