<p><strong>Brian Russell's Laws of Software Relativity</strong> (cf. Belady and 
  Lehman's Laws of Software Evolution) <br>
  * As a software project approaches release, its mass increases. <br>
  *The energy required to release a software project is inversely proportional 
  to the time before a scheduled release. <br>
  *It takes infinite energy to release a finished product on time; therefore, 
  all software projects are both incomplete and late. <br>
  *Time is relative to the observer of a software project. The last month of development 
  appears to an outside observer to take a year. <br>
  *If a software project becomes too large, it will collapse into a black hole. 
  Time and money are absorbed but nothing ever comes out. <br>
