<p> Managers often form a [programming] team which by any reasonable judgment 
  cannot perform the designated task in the allotted time. Inevitably the team 
  is given an extension when the time limit is reached and the reality must be 
  faced. Had it been faced earlier, the work could probably have been organized 
  differently - in recognition of the longer schedule - and thus produced, in 
  the end, more quickly.<br>
